description: ELO rating system with margin-of-victory and dynamic K-factor

hyperparameters:
  # Base K-factor (MOST IMPORTANT)
  k_factor:
    - 20
    - 32
    - 40
  
  # Initial team ratings
  initial_rating:
    - 1500
  
  # Home ice advantage (IMPORTANT)
  home_advantage:
    - 50
    - 100
    - 150
  
  # Margin of Victory adjustment (IMPORTANT)
  mov_multiplier:
    - 0.0      # Ignore goal differential
    - 1.0      # Linear with goal diff
    - 1.5
  
  mov_method:
    - linear
    - logarithmic
  
  # Season carryover
  season_carryover:
    - 0.67
    - 0.75
    - 0.85
  
  # Overtime/Shootout
  ot_win_multiplier:
    - 0.75
    - 1.0
  
  # Rest days advantage
  rest_advantage_per_day:
    - 0
    - 10
  
  # Back-to-back penalty
  b2b_penalty:
    - 0
    - 50

defaults:
  k_factor: 32
  initial_rating: 1500
  home_advantage: 100
  mov_multiplier: 1.0
  mov_method: logarithmic
  season_carryover: 0.75
  ot_win_multiplier: 0.75
  rest_advantage_per_day: 10
  b2b_penalty: 50

notes: |
  Reduced to core parameters for efficient tuning.
  Total grid size: 3 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 648 combinations
  
  Focus on:
  - k_factor: rating volatility
  - home_advantage: home ice effect
  - mov_multiplier/method: blowout weighting
  - season_carryover: year-to-year regression

notes: |
  K-factor: Higher = ratings change more per game (more volatile)
  
  Home advantage: Rating boost for home team (typical is 50-100)
  
  MOV multiplier: Weight margin of victory
    - 0 = only win/loss matters
    - Higher = goal differential matters more
  
  Season carryover: How much of rating to keep next season
    - 1.0 = full carryover
    - 0.67 = regress 1/3 toward mean
  
  This is important for presentation - implement from scratch!
